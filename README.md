# Eye-Exercise
The code for this exercise was created by faculty for MiT xPro's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course (August 2022 cohort). I modified the style of the map.

### Project Description
This front-end exercise is from Module 8: Styles and Bootstrap. When the web page is viewed, two CSS styled "eyes" follow the user's mouse movement around the screen. The functionality is made possible via JavaScript mouse events (mouse move, mouse leave), which control the eye objects on the DOM. Originally, one eye was provided. I created a second eye object and positioned it via CSS grid. I overlaid a mask image and modified the style attributes of the eyeball and background by adding gradients, changing positioning, and changing size.

### How to Locally Run the Eye-Exercise
From this Eye-Exercise repository, download the following files:
index.html
eyes.js
styles.css
Next, open index.html in a browser window.

### Future Improvements
I have some redesign ideas for this project.
* I hard coded the elements with absolute positioning. However, I will adjust the code to make it responsive, so it appears correctly on any screen, instead of only lining up on my MacBook Pro.
